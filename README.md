# Reack-Assessment

I have developed the project using React 18.3.2. React is ligher to work with on such a small task compared to Angular and that's why I preferred using it to Angular. I have used taiwindCSS because it easier to use than bootstrap or material and also it manages dark mode better.

Packages I am using in the project are;

- Tailwind CSS
- React-router-dom

## How to run

- Clone the project in your local machine
  `git clone https://github.com/NickyMwangi/agile-assessment.git`

    `npm run dev`

  to run the project and open the project from `http://localhost:5050/`

  ## CI/CD Pipelines

  The are set of automated processes than manage the build, test, deployment and monitoring of code changes. Some of the tools I can use for this are Azure DevOps and Docker. I have used Sonar Cloud for running tests. For this project I have added a .yml file for deploying the project to Test, Staging and production environments.
